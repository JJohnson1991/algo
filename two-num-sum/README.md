# Two number Sum


Write a function that takes a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representig a target Sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in a array in any order. If no two numbers um up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. 


Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing the two different integers in the array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.
